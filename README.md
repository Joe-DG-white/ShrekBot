# ShrekBot
<b> My first python project </b>

This is a bot that generates a random number from 0 to the amount of lines in a text file(shrek.txt). That number then gets assoicated with a line in the text file. If the line is empty (a line break) a new number is generated, this loop continues until a line with text is selected. This line is the tweeted out (@RandomShrekLine) using the tweety module.
